WATER MASK GENERATION TASK

Generate a grayscale shader mask based on this isometric pixel art image. Render all landmasses as solid black (#000000) and all water areas as white (#FFFFFF). Apply a soft Gaussian blur specifically INTO the water from the shoreline boundary to create a smooth gradient transition between the land and water for use as a distance field. Remove all internal details, buildings, and textures, leaving only the blurred silhouette of the coast.

ALL LAND MUST BE BLACK - the soft gaussian blur should start at the edge of the landmass/non-water areas and GO INTO THE WATER - it should be ~25px wide for the largest waves (e.g. hard edges/cliffs) and the blur should be ~5px wide for the smallest waves (e.g. docks, soft features).

There should be no blur on the edges of bridges, buildings, or other feature ABOVE the water.
