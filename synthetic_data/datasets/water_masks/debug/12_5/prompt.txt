WATER MASK GENERATION TASK

Generate a grayscale shader mask based on this isometric pixel art image. Render all landmasses as solid black (#000000) and all water areas as white (#FFFFFF). Apply a soft Gaussian blur specifically along the shoreline boundary to create a smooth gradient transition between the land and water for use as a distance field. Remove all internal details, buildings, and textures, leaving only the blurred silhouette of the coast.
