DARK MODE / NIGHTTIME GENERATION TASK

Transform this isometric pixel art image from daytime to nighttime. The goal is to create a realistic nighttime version that:

1. LIGHTING:
   - Reduce overall brightness significantly (nighttime ambient light)
   - Add warm yellow/orange lights in building windows (randomly lit, not all windows)
   - Add subtle blue-ish moonlight tint to exposed surfaces
   - Street lights should cast warm pools of light on streets/sidewalks
   - Neon signs and shop fronts should glow with vibrant colors

2. COLORS:
   - Shift all colors toward cooler/darker tones
   - Shadows should be deep blue/purple, not just black
   - Water should reflect city lights with subtle shimmer
   - Sky areas (if visible) should be dark blue/black

3. ATMOSPHERE:
   - Maintain all the structural details of buildings and streets
   - Keep the isometric pixel art style intact
   - The image should feel cozy and urban-nightlife-like

4. PRESERVE:
   - Exact same perspective and composition
   - All building shapes, roads, and structural elements
   - The pixel art aesthetic and style

Output a nighttime version of the exact same scene.
