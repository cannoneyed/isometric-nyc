DARK MODE / NIGHTTIME GENERATION TASK

Transform this isometric pixel art image from daytime to nighttime. The goal is to create a realistic nighttime version that:

1. LIGHTING:
   - Reduce overall brightness significantly (nighttime ambient light)
   - Add subtle blue-ish moonlight tint to exposed surfaces

2. COLORS:
   - Shift all colors toward cooler/darker tones
   - Shadows should be deep blue/purple, not just black
   - Sky areas (if visible) should be dark blue/black

4. PRESERVE:
   - Exact same perspective and composition
   - The pixel art aesthetic and style
   - DO NOT ADD ANY NEW WATER OR FEATURES

Output a nighttime version of the exact same scene. DO NOT ADD ANY BUILDINGS IF THEY ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE INPUT IMAGE.
