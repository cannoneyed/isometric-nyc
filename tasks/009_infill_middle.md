# Middle Infill Generation

In contrast to our standard quadrant-based infill generation, we need to be able
to generate "in-between" quadrants for the following scenario

A C x G I B D x H J

If we want to generate the quadrants in between C and G (x) and in between D and
H (x), then we need to be able to create an image where the left quarter is C D
and the right quarter is G H.
