# Clean up git repo

I want to deploy the app (and associated code) to github - but first, we need to clean up some of the contents.

Unfortunatley, we seem to have committed at various times many large png files, particularly in the `generations` dir... I want to scrub the git history of those png files.

The only png files we should keeo 

I also want to scrub the git history of any `node_modules` that may have been committed.
