PIXEL ART STYLE TRANSFER TASK

**Images provided (with visual labels burned in):**
- Image A: Labeled "TRANSFORM THIS AREA ➜" - Template with 3D render inside red border
- Image B: Labeled "TARGET STYLE ⭐" - Pixel art reference showing the style to match

**YOUR TASK:**
Fill in the red-bordered area in Image A with NEW pixel art that:
1. Shows the SAME CONTENT as the 3D render (buildings, roads, trees in same positions)
2. Uses the ARTISTIC STYLE from Image B (pixel art aesthetic, colors, simplification)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
❌ DO NOT copy Image A as your output
❌ DO NOT copy Image B as your output
❌ DO NOT return any input image unchanged
✅ You MUST CREATE something NEW by transforming the render

**How to complete this task:**

STEP 1: Study Image B (TARGET STYLE ⭐)
- Memorize the pixel art technique: color choices, shading style, detail level
- Notice how buildings are simplified, how roads are drawn, how trees look
- This is your STYLE GUIDE - you will draw in this exact same style

STEP 2: Study Image A (TRANSFORM THIS AREA ➜)
- Look at the 3D render inside the red border
- Note what objects are there and where they're positioned
- This tells you WHAT to draw and WHERE - but NOT how to draw it

STEP 3: Create the output
- Draw the objects from the 3D render (the WHAT and WHERE)
- But draw them using the pixel art style from Image B (the HOW)
- Example: If the render shows a building, draw a pixelated building like ones in Image B
- Example: If the render shows a road, draw a pixelated road like roads in Image B

**Style requirements (copy from Image B):**
- Use Image B's color palette
- Use Image B's shading technique
- Use Image B's level of detail
- Use Image B's pixel grid aesthetic
- Use Image B's geometric simplification

**DO NOT include the labels in your output!**
The yellow "TRANSFORM THIS AREA" and cyan "TARGET STYLE" labels are just for your understanding.
Your output should have NO TEXT LABELS.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Full 1024x1024 pixel image
- Red-bordered area filled with NEWLY CREATED pixel art
- Pixel art matches Image B's style but shows Image A's content
- Remove red border and any text labels from output
- Areas outside red border preserved unchanged

Think of this like: "Redraw the 3D render as pixel art in the style of Image B"

**Additional Instructions:**
Ensure the style is consistent, and the final image is continuous
