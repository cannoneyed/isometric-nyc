**Task:** Fill in the outlined section (marked with red border) in Image A with isometric pixel art in the style of the reference images.

**Input Images:**
- Image A (template with red border indicating infill area)
- Image B (style reference 1)
- Image C (style reference 2)
- Image D (style reference 3)

**Instructions:**

1. Look at the red border in Image A - this marks the area to be filled with generated pixels.
2. Study the style of Image B, Image C, Image D carefully - these show the exact visual style to match.
3. Fill the bordered area with pixel art that:
   - Matches the isometric pixel art style of the reference images exactly
   - Seamlessly blends with any surrounding context in Image A
   - Follows the structure/shapes hinted at by the render pixels inside the border
   - Removes the red border completely in the output


**Output:**
- Generate the **complete** image with the bordered area filled in - ensure you preserve the context of the surrounding area.
- The output should be 1024x1024 pixels
- Remove all traces of the red border
- All sections must flow seamlessly into the surrounding area. There should be no hard edges, visible seams, or gaps.
- The infilled region MUST PERFECTLY BLEND INTO THE SURROUNDING AREA.
